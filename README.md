It‚Äôs perfect for PvE arenas, adventure maps, or just chaotic fun with friends. With a few quick clicks, players can launch themselves sky-high, slam the ground with seismic force, and watch spectacular particle and sound effects unfold.

## üöÄ Features

- **SMASHER Sword**  
  A custom Netherite sword called the ‚ÄúSMASHER,‚Äù complete with a bold, underlined red name and a full suite of hidden enchantments. It stands out in any hotbar.

- **Three-Click ‚ÄúSMASH‚Äù Activation**  
  Right-click three times in rapid succession to transform your SMASHER into a mighty mace and blast yourself upward.

- **Ground-Slam Finish**  
  If you don‚Äôt use any other ability mid-air, landing will automatically slam you back into the ground, restoring your SMASHER and delivering an earth-shaking impact.

- **Cooldown & Action-Bar Prompts**  
  After unleashing a SMASH, the ability goes on cooldown. Animated action-bar messages keep players informed of recharge progress.

- **Seamless Command Integration**  
  Instantly grant a SMASHER to any player with a single command:  
  ```txt
  /specialswords give smasher

No special permissions are required by default.

* **Automatic Cleanup**
  Any ‚Äúlifted mace‚Äù items that fall to the ground are removed automatically, keeping your world tidy.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download the JAR**
   Place the `SpecialSwords.jar` file into your server‚Äôs `plugins/` directory.

2. **Restart or Reload**
   Restart your server (recommended) or run `/reload` if necessary, however using `/reload` is HIGHLY discouraged.

3. **Install the Resource Pack (optional but suggested)**
   Download the [SpecialSwords Resource Pack](https://github.com/bonknetwork/SpecialSwords-Resourcepack/releases/) and add it to your server.

4. **Verify**
   Look for ‚ÄúSpecialSwords enabled!‚Äù in the console log to confirm successful loading.

That‚Äôs all‚Äîno extra configuration files needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Give Yourself a SMASHER**

   ```txt
   /specialswords give smasher
   ```

   You‚Äôll receive a custom Netherite sword named **SMASHER** in your inventory.

2. **Unleash the SMASH**

    * **Right-click** three times quickly: you vault into the air wielding a molten mace.
    * **Land** to automatically slam down, returning the SMASHER to your hand.

3. **Watch the Cooldown**
   After your SMASH attack, your action bar displays ‚ÄúRecharging‚Ä¶‚Äù with animated dots until the ability is ready again.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I use this on non-Paper servers?**
A: No. SpecialSwords relies on Paper 1.21.4 APIs for custom item models and Brigadier command registration.

**Q: Does it require permissions?**
A: By default, no. Anyone can run `/specialswords give smasher`. Use a permissions plugin if you want to restrict access.

**Q: Will this impact performance?**
A: No. The plugin runs two lightweight repeating tasks (cleanup and action-bar updates) and automatically disposes of its own dropped items.
